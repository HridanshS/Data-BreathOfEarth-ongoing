## How to run the files

To run the webpage locally on your machine using Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension, follow these steps:

Install Visual Studio Code: Make sure Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is installed on the machine. If it's not, download and install it from the official website.

Download a Zip file of this project, Unzip it to have the project folder
Open the Web Project: Open the folder containing this web project in Visual Studio Code.

Install the Live Server Extension:
Open the Extensions sidebar by clicking on the square icon in the left sidebar (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS).
In the search bar, type "Live Server" and hit Enter.
Click the "Install" button for the "Live Server" extension offered by Ritwick Dey.
Wait for the installation to complete.

Open the HTML File:
Locate the index.html file within the project folder.

Start Live Server:
Right-click on the index.html file.
In the context menu that appears, select "Open with Live Server."

Access the Local Website:
After clicking "Open with Live Server," your default web browser will launch.
The webpage will open in your browser, served locally from the Live Server.

That's it! You've successfully run the webpage locally using Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension. The website should be accessible at a local URL (usually something like http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html), allowing you to view and interact with it on the your machine.



Some of the features I have implemented:
- x-axis filter for Graph1
- ability to select countries whose data should show on Graph1
- ability to click on points to focus on a certain country
- For Graph 2 ability to choose which variable should display
- For Graph 2, hover over tooltip


Ways in which I have built on feedback from M3 Static Viz Design:
- Improved on labels - earlier ones had some unclear labels
- Only indicators/variables with comparable ranges used on graphs where multiple indicators are displayed
- Shape encoding clarified in Graph 1
