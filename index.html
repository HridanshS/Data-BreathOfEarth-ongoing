              Two more Visualizations to go! Feel free to play around with Viz Uno and come back<br>
              When you are ready, press the arrow at bottom of your screen
              <p>
                <strong>Visualization Dos</strong> <br>
                This viz is now looking at the data at a city-level - each record in the dataset<br>
                The x-axis shows the AQI Index value - the specific index being looked at can be changed with the 'Select Variable' dropdown<br>
                On the y-axis we see how many times did a specific value (from the x-axis) occur in the entire dataset. In other words, 
                how many times (cummulative) was that particular variable value experienced across the world, based on the data?
                <br>
                Hover over the red line to see the exact information about the specific datapoint<br>
                <strong>Viz's Goal: </strong> Aid in discerning the distribution of the AQI Variable at a global scale<br>
                Viz helps recognise aspects such as the most common AQI value globally
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Visualization Tres</strong> <br>
                After exploring at a country level, we moved to a city level, now let's move up the granularity index and see things at a Continent perspective.
                The continent was not mentioned in the original Kaggle dataset and was added later<br> <br>
                Here we can see 2 vars (pre-defined) - avg Ozone AQI Value & avg PM2.5 AQI Value (each is aggregated at a Continent level and hence are averages) - on the y and x axis respectively.
                <br>
                This viz helps us see where each continent is placed based on its AQI Value for two different variables. From this viz, we can recognize that Asia performs poorly 
                on both particulate matter in the air (PM2.5) and the presence of Ozone in the air. 
                <br> <br>
                Also note the size of dots: the dot sizes differ - it is another variable encoding (which can be chosen from the 'Choose Variable' filter). 
                This var controls the size of the dots. <br> The default AQI_Unhealthy means the continents are classified (in sizing) based on the number of cities
                that were tagged 'Unhealthy' or 'Very Unhealthy' based on their Overall AQI value. Hover over point to see the # of Unhealthy cities in continent
                <br>
                <b>Note: </b>some continents are better represented in data (caution in making comparisons)

              Awesome job reaching here!
              Now, let me tell you more about my poetic journey:
              <p>
                My journey has culminated in this project. It has been quite an exploration of my emotions and experiences. 
                While conveying my feelings has been challenging, the process has been remarkably rewarding.
                Crafting the verses - that you see on your left - are meant to resonate with my readers (you guys) and capture the importance of sustainability; this has been both fun and fulfilling. 
                <br> <br>
                Enough about me, let's talk about the 1st Visualization (linked to 1st verse)
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Visualization Uno</strong> <br>
                This Viz shows three AQI Values (names in legend) by the number of times the Country is mentioned (or appears) in my AQI dataset.
                So for each country, there are three markers - all three markers for a specific country share the same y-axis value 
                (because the # of times a country appeared in the dataset does not change - it is a constant fact).
                <br>
                On the x-axis you can read the value for each of these markers. It is interesting that three different variables (represented as markers) 
                all fit on the same x-axis range (this was intentional!). As with all AQI values in this dataset, the lower the value, the better the air quality               
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, the viz looks very messy at first - all the datapoints make it look cluttered. Don't you worry...I have a trick for you<br>
                <b>Focus mode:</b> Click on any marker on the visualization itself and voila! All the markers (3) for that specific country are highlighted<br>
                Phew, this makes it easier to compare the three markers/variables for the specific country. <b>Want to go back?</b> Just click on any of the highlighted markers again and like a switch, it toggles off!
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Use the filters:</b> There are 2 filters for this viz which aid your understanding of data<br>
                Only want countries in a certain value range? Use the X-Axis Filter (the blue slider)<br>
                Want to look at a specifc country by name? Scroll in the 'Select Countries' filter and find them. You can choose multiple countries too!

              Hello! Welcome to my Interactive Visualization Implementation :) 
              <p>
                In this project, I have an interactive implementation of my data-driven poem. There are various different interactivities & I am going to walk you through it. <br>
                First, let us start with data <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>THE DATA</strong><br>
                This dataset offers a comprehensive view of air quality, focusing on key pollutants that significantly impact public health.<br>
                It encompasses AQI (Air Quality Index) values from various cities worldwide, covering a range of pollutants like Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5). <br><br>
                
                This dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying air pollution's global impact on public well-being and environmental health.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>NO2, originating from both natural and human sources, poses health risks, especially to individuals with respiratory conditions.</li>
                <li>Ozone, when present at ground level due to chemical reactions, can lead to chest discomfort and lung problems.</li>
                <li>CO (Carbon Monoxide), primarily emitted by vehicles and certain appliances, can be hazardous, affecting oxygen transport in the bloodstream.</li>
                <li>Particulate Matter, classified as a carcinogen, includes fine particles that can lead to severe heart and lung issues.</li>
              </ul>
